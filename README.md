# Rework Site

My very first website written completely by hand (no full copy-paste from AI).

## What is this project?

This is my learning project where I'm teaching myself frontend development from scratch:  
HTML • CSS • Vanilla JavaScript

Goal: eventually move to React + Node.js and become a junior fullstack developer.

## Current features

- Responsive header with burger menu (mobile)
- Side menu slides in from the left on mobile
- Burger icon changes to × when menu is open
- Close button (×) inside the side menu
- Basic dark header + light content sections
- Hover effects on buttons
- Using CSS variables (:root) for colors (partially)

## Live Demo

## Tech stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (vanilla, no frameworks yet)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## Plans / What's next

- Improve visual design & add more sections
- Add dark/light theme toggle (with localStorage)
- Make fully responsive (desktop menu)
- Add Google Fonts
- Create additional pages (About, Goals, etc.)
- Move towards React
